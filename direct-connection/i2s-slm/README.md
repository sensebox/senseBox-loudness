# I2S Sound Level Meter

Based on the ESP32-I2S-SLM program by Ivan Kostoski. (https://github.com/ikostoski/esp32-i2s-slm)

Simplified version in more Arduino style without the Freetos funcionality concentrating only on the ICS43434 microphone.

The program calculates the dB values from the microphone output and applies the weighting filter(s).
